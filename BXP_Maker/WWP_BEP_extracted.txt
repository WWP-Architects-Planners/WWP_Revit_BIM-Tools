Scope of BEP
SvN Architects + Planners aims to use Building Information Modeling (BIM) to increase the quality and consistency of our deliverables, increase the refinement of coordination between consultants and increase the overall quality of design in our projects.
Overview
This BIM Execution Plan (BEP) is intended to provide the Project Team with an understanding of agreed expectations with regards to the BIM process, including opportunities to have clarity and effective collaboration among participants. 
It is meant to be a “living” document that establishes collective agreements by the project participants to the BIM process, allowing them to customize and incorporate their individual needs as well as to document project specific workflows as agreed on by the entire team. As such, the BEP is provided to the team as an editable document so that it may be filled in and customized. 
The BEP is recommended to be reviewed at every milestone submission.

Upgrades + Hot Fixes
During the project new versions of application software may become available. Upgrading of models or project data to newer versions should be reviewed with all team members to ensure compatibility. If the team decides an upgrade is beneficial to the project a protocol will be developed, tested (in a non-production environment), outlined in this document and performed upon written agreement by all team members.  
Consultants upgrading or using platforms not listed above without following the procedures outlined above will be responsible for the time costs incurred to each Consultant because of the upgrade or will be required to return to a model from pre-upgrade to continue working with, at no cost to the Project Budget.
Post-Mortem meeting
SvN will conduct a Post-Mortem meeting after major project milestones and important submission to client or authorities. The purpose of these meetings is to bring up any major issues in collaborations that could be improved for future submission. The Post-Mortem meetings will be performed at the following milestone submissions:

Workshared Archives
Should the need arise to create an archived design version of a file that needs to be workshared, the copy shall be placed under the 05-ARCHIVED folder. It is important not to keep archives under the 01-DESIGN folder space as it will appear on the Design Collaboration module. ACC maintains all deleted model and every week’s version of the model can. Geo-Referencing, Project Origin and North.
Design Collaboration Module – Sharing and Consuming Packages
Disciplines partaking in linking through the 02-SHARED folder are encouraged to share their model “package” often through the Design Collaboration during coordination periods.

Location Dimensions: Indicates the discipline responsible for providing location dimensions for the listed model elements.
Visibility Control: Indicates how the visibility of model elements is controlled. Elements that are indicated “By Workset” need to be placed on a unique workset. Workset naming should be in accordance with the workset naming conventions in this document and agreed upon at the project kickoff meeting.
Coordinate System and Acquiring coordinates
All Revit files in the collaborative environment must have the same coordinate system.
The Geocoordinate system will be: 
Coordinates will be acquired from the following Revit model.
Project Origin and Project North 
The architectural consultant will define project origin to be followed by the design consultants. Although files are to be linked by shared coordinates (geo-located see B.7.1.), files should share the same internal origin location defined within the project area, especially for AutoCAD dwg files. 
Project origin will be set to the following Revit ‘Internal Origin’:
[Include below description and screenshot of known true reference (Gridline or Property Line corner):]
Internal Origin
Project North
When building a Federated Model, it is required that all component models utilize the same geo-referencing as the Design Revit Models.

Glossary
Construction Model
An aggregated model (Revit or non-Revit), managed by the Construction Manager / General Contractor, comprised of multiple design, contractor and trade fabrication models as required to enable the generation of a virtual coordination environment during construction.
Design Model
Individual models (Revit) that are created and maintained exclusively by members of the design team.  These models are kept current throughout construction incorporating all construction changes issued through the Owner’s standard format for documenting changes to the work.
Fabrication Model
Highly detailed model generated by a trade (non-Revit) to enable prefabrication and detailed virtual coordination prior to construction. For example, while a ‘Design Model’ for HVAC ductwork will include duct sizes at various elevations, the ‘Fabrication Model’ will additionally include necessary weld gaps, hangers and design tolerances for its fabrication.
Federated Model
A single model (non-Revit) that is comprised of multiple models from various sources whose identity or integrity cannot be modified through changes made to other models. Normally, a federated model is used to bring together ‘Design Model’, ‘Site Model’ and ‘Fabrication Models’ into a single environment for the purpose of virtual coordination during Design and Build phases.
Record Model
Final updated ‘Design Models’ (Revit), including changes required by the project ‘Accuracy Table’ to reflect the agreed as constructed condition. Models contain views, rooms, sheets and schedules used to generate 2D construction documents.
Virtual Coordination
Refers to both the Digital Building Review Process (manual) and the Clash Review Process (semi-automated) to ensure design is properly resolved.
Design Models
 (Schematic Design, Design Development, AHJ Submissions, Contract Documents)
The Design Models as well as an accompanying PDF are to be made available for the client’s analysis and audit. The model will be uploaded and submitted to the FTP platform at the specific intervals and project milestones detailed above.  The model is to be fully coordinated with all major disciplines to the LOD identified for each phase as defined in this document. 
The model is to be used as an analytical tool to investigate architectural solutions while exploring elements of the design. It should assist in the functional program development and validate with regards to space distribution and functionality. It should facilitate investigations of building and energy performance while providing the process for building systems integration. 
The BIM model should assist the team with sustainable and green strategies. Materials and methods analysis should be an integral process and incorporated into the model. 
Tender Model(s)
The Tender Model(s) will be submitted to the Client via upload to the FTP site. The models will then be made available by the Client to the General Contractor and bidding team for reference. The team will not provide a tender model for an open bid process. Crozier’s Tender models can be provided to awarded GC/Contractors with a signed digital document release form.
NOTE: The Tender Model may be amended by the owner during the bid process via addenda.
Issued for Construction Model
The IFC BIM (Issued for Construction) Model represents the final Design Model and the final model issuance from the consultant team (Architect, Structural, MEP). It will be a Revit file compiled and prepared by the Consultant team. It will be provided to the Client and Construction Manager for reference alongside the Issued for Construction contract documents. The Revit IFC Model will be a non-editable, reference model only fit for adapted use by the Construction Manager. 
Contract Admin Model
The consultant team will continue to use the IFC model and adapt for their uses during construction to respond to RFIs, Site Instructions and Change Orders. This model will serve as an internal tool and will not be shared with the contractor or kept up to date with as-built conditions on site. After the IFC model is issued, the GC will take responsibility for updating the construction model as coordination with the trades progresses.
As Built Model
The As-Built Model will be a BIM file compiled and prepared by the Construction Manager. The details of the As-Built Model will be determined and agreed between the Construction Manager and the Client.
Workset
The collaborative nature of BIM dictates a need for simultaneous access to the Revit model by multiple users. Revit accomplishes this through its Worksharing functionality, a capability that allows users to gain exclusive access to sets of objects at a time, without the need to lock out access to the whole file.
Worksets are expected to be used for organizing workflow and the logical division of scope by discipline. Each linked Revit model should be hosted on a separate workset. This approach significantly assists in improving Revit Model(s) access performance and visibility control. 
The use of worksets should be minimized and used with the intent of controlling visibility and permissions when required. Any content not relevant to other parties should be kept on its own workset, clearly identified as being for internal use. The strategy for the guidelines is to provide a prefix and a means of communicating the intention of the workset.

LOD
Level
Name
Description
Typical Project Phase
LOD 100
Conceptual
The model element is represented by a symbol or generic massing. No specific dimensions or locations are yet defined. Used for basic spatial studies and area calculations.
Pre-Design / Feasibility
LOD 200
Schematic
The element is a generic placeholder. It has approximate quantities, size, shape, and location. It is "recognizable" (e.g., you can tell it’s a wall or a window) but still not specific.
Schematic Design
LOD 300
Detailed
The element is represented as a specific system, object, or assembly with accurate dimensions, shape, location, and orientation. This is the baseline for construction documentation.
Design Development
LOD 350
Construction
Includes interfaces and connections with other building systems (e.g., how a wall attaches to a slab). Crucial for clash detection and interdisciplinary coordination.
Construction Documentation
LOD 400
Fabrication
The model is detailed enough for manufacturing and shop drawings. Includes precise fabrication info, fasteners, and assembly instructions.
Fabrication / Construction
LOD 500
As-Built
The model has been field-verified. It reflects the actual installed conditions, including final positions and maintenance data. Used for facility management.

Syncing, Publishing, Sharing, Consuming in ACC
Autodesk Construction Cloud Docs Module
This section refers to specific collaboration method on the Autodesk Construction Cloud as set up by SvN Architects+Planners. 
Autodesk Docs is a cloud-based common data environment that provides document management and control to the entire project team. With Autodesk Docs, AEC teams can simplify collaboration and data management from design to construction and streamline document review and approval workflows.
ACC Docs hub has been configured in the following breakdown.
MAIN FOLDER
DESCRIPTION
00-RESOURCES
Shared folder for any multidiscipline BIM material, including this BIM Execution Plan.
01-DESIGN
WIP space for drawing production. Each discipline has its own workspace with protected write privileges.
02-SHARED
The Shared folder is populated automatically by “sharing packages” through the ACC Design Collaboration module.  From the Design Collaboration module, teams can also “consume” packages to automatically bring package documents into their 01-Design workspace under the “Consumed” folder for linking and references. 
03-PUBLISHED
Published folder will serve as a record of milestone submissions for all disciplines. The subfolders within will not be structured by disciplines, but rather by milestones
04-ARCHIVED
Archived folder will contain any necessary archived models that may need to remain accessible to the team. It is important not to keep archived models within the 01-DESIGN folder as these will appear in the Design Collaboration module.
This is an example of the workflow of documents between ACC Docs folders
Uploading a Revit file
In order to upload a Revit file into ACC for collaboration, the file needs to be brought into ACC from within the Revit interface, through the Collaborate tab, Collaborate in Cloud. The model should be placed in the 01-Design folder path, under the appropriate discipline. 
Sharing Process
The following section provides an example workflow for sharing files among other task teams and parties. 
Sharing files is a two-way communication. Files must be shared by the originating team and consumed by the other teams to be included in their workflow. This is typically referred to as a "Low-trust environment", or controlled sharing. This ensures that teams receive information as appropriate to their workflow. Systematically, this results in files being copied from 02-Shared into a "Consumed" folder for each team, as depicted below:
Publishing Models
Publishing a model on ACC archives a version of a model on the hub.
The ACC hub has been configured to auto-publish Revit models every Friday at 22:00 EST. Publishing can also be done by any user prior to sharing or when a specific milestone has been reached. Publishing a model must be done through the Revit Home interface. 
4.6 Published Views and Sheets in the Model
ACC allows certain views to be viewed at a glance on the web interface. These views need to be selected within the Revit File from the Collaborate Tab &gt; Publish Settings.
All Revit models should have selected the following views as Publish:
	View Type	View Name	Description
1	3D View	3D_Coordination 	Only local geometries. No Links
2	3D View	3D_Coordination_Links	View with any relevant links loaded
3	Sheets	(Sheet Names)	Any sheet that is part of the set
Sharing Models
Co-ordination meetings will happen in a bi-weekly schedule unless more co-ordination is required as the project advances. Models will be shared during the in-between week to allow all disciplines to review, make changes and track comments to be presented at the next coordination meeting.
 Once a model has been published it can be shared in the design collaboration module. 
 From the Design Collaboration module, the timeline can be expanded (•••) to see all packages shared by each discipline. A package can be started by selecting the (+ Create Package) 
Standard naming of packages is “Bristol Tower 1 - Package Purpose.”
Example:	Bristol Tower 1 - Shared for Costing  
Consuming Models
Through the Design Collaboration module, one can review models issued by other disciplines and “consume” them, meaning, they will be automatically copied into your respective DESIGN folder under the Docs ACC module, under the folder “consumed.”
When browsing through the Design Collaboration timeline, a filled bubble means the package has already been consumed by your team. A hollow bubble means the package has not been consumed by your team. A dashed bubble is a draft package by your team.
Once the empty bubble is “Consumed” the shared file will be copied into the proper discipline (In this case, ARCH) into the consumed folder for the team to reference. 
DWG Container Files
Why use a Container?
Using a geolocated dwg container file is the best way to keep your project model lean, ensure a linked DWG does not show up on other views, keep you dwg truly geolocated, avoid most graphic glitches, and create a single file to manage multiple dwg's from a single consulting discipline. 
A project specific geolocated container can be found in ACC 00-RESOURCES
Linking DWG to a geolocated blank:
First make a copy of the geolocated blank so you create a disciplne specific container. You can do this by saving the blank to your desktop first, then under the Collaborate Tab, "Collaborate to Cloud" that blank into the approate disciple folders in your projects ACC.
Go to the set up Container Vew and change its name to reflect DWG origin or disciipline and its tile. 
One DWG Container may contain multiple DWG's within, all dwg's willl be controlled via view parameters.
Load your projects Revit link, (or link in your project via shared coordaintes) and under Visibility/Graphics&gt;Links, set the visibility "By View" and choose a clean view that shows all required reference geometries, i.e. Property Line, Ground floor envelope, Roof outline, etc.
Link a DWG to this Revit. Ensure you select the following settings.
a) Current view only (YES)b) Colors (Monochrome)c) Layers/Level (All)d) Import Units (Auto-Detect)e) Correct Lines.. (NO)f) Positioning: (Manual - Origin)e) Place at: (Level 01)h) Oriante to View (NO)6. Once you place the DWG, move it, carefully aligining it using the linked project references.7. Pin the DWG!8. In the view slect the DWG and thing if you want this dwg to appear as a foreground or background object. If you need both for diferent views, simply, "Copy View with Detailing" and make two views, one with dwg as foreground, one with dwg as background. Ensure the view name is clear.
Loading the DWG Container to your model:
Link the DWG Container to your project file in the appropriate workset, because all the dwg's should be set to "Current View Only" you will not see anything right away.
In the view where you need the DWG, under Visibility/Graphics change the visibility of the DWG Container to "By Linked View" and select the view you've created.
